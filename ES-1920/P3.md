#### Rationale
The first use case that we decided to test was the creation of a query by a student. In this test we also check the capacity to update and remove a query.
The second use case that we test is the capacity by a teacher to answer a query created by a student. For this second use case scenario test if the teacher is able to update and remove an answer.
We also test the use case scenarios with invalid choices, such as invalid title, invalid content and trying to delete queries that have been answered.
